    <div class="container story">
      <p> Located just across the East River from Midtown, Astoria had long been considered an ideal neighbourhood for people who wanted to live close to Manhattan without breaking the bank. In 2009, the real median gross rent in Astoria was 1,470$/month, making it the fourth cheapest neighbourhood in Queens in terms of rent. Ten years later, rent in Astoria jumped to 1,870$/month, making it the fourth most expensive neighbourhood in the borough. Even more remarkable is the fact that rents in Astoria increased at a higher rate compared to the rest of the city. While on average, median gross rents in New York City rose by 14% from 2009 to 2019, rents in Astoria increased by 21,5 % over that time period.</p>

    <div class="container story">
    <p> For Carolina Korth, the co-founder of Astoria Not For Sale, an organization pushing back against gentrification in Astoria, these rent increases are largely due to the emergence of luxury apartment complexes in the area. "When you suddenly have really expensive luxury housing, and all the businesses that come with it, neighbouring landlords want to cash in on this,‚Äù said Korth. "We've seen this happen in places like Williamsburg or Downtown Brooklyn, and it's now a trend in Astoria as well." </p>
